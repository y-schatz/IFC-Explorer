# IFC Explorer
### What is it ? 
IFC Explorer is a tool for researchers, programmers or other advanced users working with IFC (Industry Foundation Classes).\
It allows the user to explore the entire IFC tree structure in a single window and search for IFC classes to obtain concise information.\
This supplements the documentation provided by buildingSMART for the IFC schema.

### Concretely, what are the functions of IFC Explorer ?
**With the release 1.0.0 you can :** 
  
• **Explore** intuitively the tree structure of the IFC schema just by clicking on the entity names, so the sub-entities are displayed in the next list level. The "rooted" and "resource" entities are distinguished.\
• **Search** any element of the schema (entity, defined type, enumeration type, select type, property set, property enumeration, quantity set) by its information like regular name, german name, direct or inverse attribute name, property name, enumeration constant...\
• **Get** details about selected element, and find automatically its path into the IFC three structure.\
• **Export** the active selection path to GraphML.
